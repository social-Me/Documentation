#Overview:
  "social-Me" will be an Application (both Android App and Website) designed and developed specifically to handle most widely used social networking Apps like WhatsApp, Hike, Facebook, Twitter, etc. As per now, App will be concentrated on Updating Status (with or without Images), changing Profile photos on one go (posting on all apps on a single click)

#Motivation:
  Social media is most important factor in today’s lifestyle. Considering the frequent use of social networking applications, there is a need to maintain the ease of access. Considering a case when a person wants to post the same information on multiple social networking media, it will be hectic and time consuming for him/her to open each application independently. Hence a platform is required where all these things can be done together.

#Goals:
  1. Reduce time to share user’s feelings on his/her different social networking Accounts.
  2. Give an User Friendly, Easy and Simple Platform to manage Posts on All social networking Accounts.
